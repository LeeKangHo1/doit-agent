Accounting for the expansion in its artists ’ overseas \n\nactivities, our  target PE  is the average PE of  SM Entertainment  (SM) \n\nand YG Entertainment  (YG)  in 2013 -2015, when their global \n\nrevenue  started to fully fledge . Despite the recent surge, we believe \n\nthere is an ample upside to J YP’s stock price. \n\nHigher profitability each quarter . Korean Entertainment companies’ \n\ndiversification efforts  have  so far caused poorer margins,  due to the \n\nlack of  synergies with their mainstay business.  Moreover , doubts \n\nover entertainment giants’ competitiveness in their m ainstay \n\nbusiness have grown, with their new idol groups generating \n\ndisappointing revenues. In contrast, J YP Entertainment is delivering \n\nbetter profitability every quarter, focusing on its core business. It is \n\nalso showing the strongest performance among li sted peers in \n\nterms of new idol groups ’ activities . F or 1Q18, J YP recorded \n\nrevenue of KRW23bn (+5% y  -o-y) and OP of KRW1.36bn ( -64% y  -\n\no-y). Excluding the one -off cost from employee stock options, 1Q18 \n\nOP would be KRW5.56bn (+46% y  -o-y) , way above consensus \n\nestimate. While revenue growth was marginal with recognition of \n\nearnings from J apan (J YP focused on the J apanese market in 1Q18) \n\ndeferred, its normalised OPM came in at 24%, a record  high, \n\nthanks to structural margin improvements. \n\nEarnings growth to sta nd out among peers . We expect J YP to see \n\nstronger -than -peers margin improvements going forward, on the \n\nback of i) growth of J apan and global revenue (high -margin \n\nmarkets), ii) the drop in the  COGS -to -revenue ratio supported by \n\nincreasing revenue from its n ew idol groups, and iii) rationalisation \n\nof SG&A expenses by focusing on its core business. For 2018, we \n\nestimate revenue of KRW119.6bn (+17% y  -o-y) and OP of \n\nKRW26.1bn (+34% y  -o-y). Excluding stock option cost, OP would \n\nbe KRW31bn.

Need to focus on specialisation, rather than diversification \n\nI-1. Business diversificat ion does not necessarily increase \n\nenterprise value \n\nHere, we compare J YP’s profitability with that of \n\ncompetitors to explain its enterprise value. \n\nIn terms of revenue, J YP underperforms its competitors with \n\nsimilar market cap. This raises doubts over the company’s \n\npotential value among some investors. Entertainment \n\ncompanies have focused on top -line growth, setting a goal \n\nof annual revenue of KRW1tr or 2tr. The two major \n\nstrategies for revenue growth are: i) vertical expansion of \n\nbu siness portfolio; and ii) horizontal revenue expansion \n\nthrough the globalisation of K -pop idol music. Our analysis \n\nof entertainment companies’ earnings shows that horizontal \n\nrevenue expansion contributes to enterprise value growth. \n\nIn contrast, vertical re venue expansion through business \n\ndiversification contributes little to enterprise value growth. \n\nAn artist’s global revenue growth contributes to margin \n\nimprovements with little fixed costs. However, business \n\ndiversification (with a new business added to th e articles of \n\nassociation) does not necessarily lead to margin \n\nimprovements, due to required capex and new investments. \n\nAs such, we think revenue comparison at current levels \n\n(secured through business diversification) is meaningless in \n\nterms of enterprise value evaluation. We recommend \n\nfocusing on future profitability and the potential value of \n\nartists under management. \n\nSM and YG Entertainment have vertically expanded their \n\nbusiness portfolios since 2015. YG has expanded into \n\ncosmetics, sport management and restaurant businesses, \n\nwhile SM has entered broadcasting contents \n\nproduction/investment s, cable broadcasting (programme \n\nprovider), ad agency, travel agency, etc. V ertical business \n\nexpansion requires initial investments and related personnel \n\nrecruitment , leading to a sharp increase in SG&A expenses. \n\nHowever, such expansion has failed to create synergy with \n\nthe mainstay business, and some businesses are even \n\nblamed for overall margin deterioration. SM saw its \n\nconsolidated OPM decline from 12% in 2014 to 3 % in \n\n2017. YG’s OPM also decreased from 14% to 7% over the \n\nsame period. \n\nMeanwhile, J YP has focused on its mainstay business, music \n\nand concerts. It avoids excessive investments with its own \n\nequity for contents production. As a result, gross profit \n\ngrowt h significantly outpaces SG&A growth. The company \n\nrecorded a KRW12bn increase in consolidated gross profit in \n\n2017. In comparison, SG&A growth (excluding one -off stock \n\ncompensation costs) was only KRW2.9bn. As such, \n\nnormalised OPM (excluding stock compensa tion costs) rose \n\nto 22% in 2017 from 18.8% in 2016. We expect SG&A \n\ngrowth to be limited at KRW1bn in 2018 when excluding \n\none -off headquarters relocation and stock compensation \n\ncosts. With gross profit growth estimated at KRW9bn, \n\nnormalised OPM should incre ase to 26% for 2018.

Artist’s global success = Enterprise value enhancement \n\nEntertainment companies saw the sharpest growth in their \n\nenterprise value, backed by increased revenue from their \n\nJ apanese business. In the early 2000s, SM, YG and J YP \n\naggressively advanced into J apan, the world’s second largest \n\nmusic market, amid the Hallyu boom. Their stock \n\nperformance was largely affected by their business results in \n\nJ apan. TV XQ/EXO (SM), BIGBANG (YG) and 2PM (J YP) made \n\ntheir debut in J apan during 2012 -2015 and delivered \n\nstronger -than -expected results. During this period, th e\n\ncompanies’ enterprise value was most highly valued. \n\nThen, Korean entertainment companies expanded their \n\nbusiness to China. However, China’s concert market is less \n\nattractive than J apan’s in terms of market size and margin, \n\nowing to profit -sharing with local promoters and high \n\nresource transport costs. Moreover, they have failed to plan \n\na large concert since 2016, due to retaliation over the \n\nTHAAD issue. Nevertheless , China -related expectations are \n\nstill the biggest factor affecting entertainment compani es’ \n\nshare prices. In 2013 -2014, Korean singers were hit hard by \n\nthe weak J apanese yen and anti -Korea sentiment, leading to \n\ncorrection in related companies’ market cap. The companies \n\nlater rebounded on the back of the launch of concerts in \n\nChina. Korean art ists, especially BIGBANG and EXO, \n\nincreased their concerts in China, spreading the perception \n\nthat J apan is a stable cash cow and China is a future growth \n\nengine (before the THAAD issue). The recent easing of \n\nChina’s restrictions on Korean content sparked renewed \n\ninterest in related companies. \n\nOverseas revenue growth leads to share price rally, as it is \n\nguaranteed profit growth. Artists’ global expansion does not \n\nrequire advanced investments. They can go global with their \n\nalbums and concerts already publi shed/designed in Korea. \n\nWith little fixed costs, global activities come with minimal \n\nrisk. Big Hit Entertainment, which represents BTS with \n\npowerful fandom, recently received investments (worth \n\nKRW880bn) from Netmarble Games. The company’s \n\nenterprise value is estimated at over KRW1tr in the market. \n\nDespite shorter history and smaller artist portfolio than the \n\ntop 3 entertainment companies, Big Hit is highly valued for \n\nits success in the US. BTS created contents for Korean fans, \n\nnot Americans, producing thei r albums and music videos for \n\nthe Korean market. However, the idol group generated \n\nrevenue in the US and other global markets , recording a\n\nmuch stronger -than -average margin in 2017.

J YP’s global expansion in its initial phase \n\nIf global revenue guarantees high profitability, J YP’s \n\nearnings outlook is bright. \n\nJ YP sees the highest upside to global revenue among its \n\npeers, considering popularity of its artists. In 2018, the \n\ncompany expects to post revenue from GOT7 and TWICE \n\nconcerts in J apan. Its J apanese concert audience stood at \n\nonly 220, 000 (70% or 140,000 from 2PM concerts and \n\n90,000 from GOT7 concerts) in 2017. We expect the figure \n\nto increase 90% y -o-y to over 400,000 in 2018. \n\nIn 1Q18, TWICE made a successful debut with Candy Pop in \n\nJ apan, with its concert audience estimated to be 180,000 \n\nfor 2018. GOT7’s concerts in 2H18 are expected to attract \n\n120,000 fans. The total audience of J YP’s J apanese concerts \n\nshould exceed the level recorded for 2PM in their heyday, \n\ntaking also into account 2PM concert and J YP Nation (group \n\nconcert) sche duled for this year. \n\nThe 2019 outlook is even brighter. With the current artist \n\nportfolio, the company’s revenue from the J apanese market \n\nshould remain robust until 2020, considering that revenue \n\nfrom TWICE and GOT7, whose fandom is expected to \n\nincrease with an arena tour in 2H18, as well as Stray Kids, \n\nwill be recognised in 2019. \n\nJ YP artists’ activities in China should also increase sharply \n\nfrom 2018. Even if existing artists cannot resume their \n\nactivities, two new idol groups will make their debut in \n\nChina in 2H18. J YP has established a local J V with Tencent \n\nto produce Chinese idol music. Boy Story is building their \n\nfandom in the current pre -debut period to prepare for their \n\ndebut in Aug 2018, while Project C (Chinese boy group) will \n\nmake their debut in 2H18. In particular, Boy Story has over \n\n100,000 subscribers on their official YouTube channel with \n\ntheir music video netting 300,000 -400,000 views. This \n\nindicates that the group has succeeded in attracting \n\nattention in the market. Considering this, J YP’ s equity -\n\nmethod gain is highly likely to increase from 2018, which \n\nshould lead to EPS growth.

Cost structure improvement \n\nArtist profit -sharing seen from shareholder’s perspective \n\nIn an enterta inment company’s COGS, profit distribution to \n\nartists accounts for the largest share. As for YG, which \n\ndiscloses related figures, annual profit distribution to artists \n\nrepresents 50% of total COGS. Given that YG’s COGS to \n\nrevenue ratio stood at 71% in 2017 , favourable profit -\n\nsharing is most important for an entertainment company’s \n\nmargin improvement. \n\nRight after an artist’s debut, profit -sharing ratio is usually set \n\nin favour of the company. Then, the deal becomes more \n\nfavourable to artists upon renewal (usually after eight years). \n\nThe profit -sharing ratio is favourable to BIGBANG (of YG) \n\nand TV XQ (of SM) , who have renewed their contracts for \n\nseveral times. In comparison, J YP’s main artists are GOT7 \n\nand TWICE. While their revenue contribution is estimated at \n\n60%, the profit -sharing ratio is more favourable to the \n\ncompany. The two groups’ contract renewal is expected in \n\n2022 and 2023, respectively. \n\nAs mentioned before, a favourable profit -sharing ratio \n\nmeans an industry -high GPM. J YP’s GPM reached 38% in \n\n2017. It should increase further to 40% in 2018, which is \n\n6ppts and 10ppts higher than that of SM and YG, \n\nrespectively. Big Hit’s high margin is also attributable to a\n\nfavourable profit -sharing ratio. We think the ratio is still low \n\nfor BTS with its contra ct renewal expected in 2020. Big Hit’s \n\nGPM reached 45% in 2017. By division, GPM came in at \n\n30% for concerts, 20% for appearance fees, 67% for \n\ncommercials, and 54% for overseas royalties. \n\nIn 2018, J YP plans to launch two new idol groups, Stray \n\nKids and a five -member girl group, in Korea. When \n\nincluding two idol groups to debut in China, the company \n\nwill boast the youngest artist portfolio among its peers. As \n\nsuch, we think J YP has the lowest risk of margin \n\ndeterioration from contract renewal.

Earni ngs outlook & valuation \n\nIII -1. 1Q18 Review: 5% revenue growth leading to 50% \n\nprofit growth \n\nJ YP posted revenue of KRW23bn (+5% y -o-y) and OP of \n\nKRW1.36bn ( -64% y -o-y) for 1Q18. Excluding one -off stock \n\ncompensation costs (KRW4.21bn), normalised OP came in a t\n\nKRW5.6bn, up 46% y -o-y. This shows that the 5% revenue \n\ngrowth had led to 50% profit growth. \n\nStock compensation costs began to increase in 2Q17. J YP’s \n\nmarket cap rose sharply on TWICE’s global success, along \n\nwith increased stock compensation costs for employees’ \n\nstock option exercise. Such costs came in at KRW3.3bn in \n\n2017. The company’s market cap has increased \n\ncontinuously, and its share price has risen 68.4% YTD (as of \n\n31 Mar, end -1Q18). As such, stock compensation costs \n\nreached KRW4.2bn for 1Q18, wit h the additional \n\ncompensation estimated at KRW900m , based on the \n\nremaining stock option grants. Among them, KRW600m \n\nwill expire within 2018 and KRW300m will expire in 1H19. \n\nAs such, stock compensation costs should decrease sharply \n\nfrom 2Q18 and dissipate a fter 1H19. This is why 1Q18 stock \n\ncompensation costs can be deemed as one -off costs. \n\nJ YP’s revenue decreased slightly q -o-q in 1Q18, owing to \n\ndecreased concerts in Korea. Domestic concert revenue \n\ndropped 49% y -o-y. However, this is attributable to TWICE ’s \n\nfocus on J apan for its activities. Like its peers, J YP’s J apan \n\nrevenue is reflected in its earnings with a 3 -6-month lag. \n\nTWICE’s J apanese concert in 1Q18 will be reflected in 2H18 \n\nearnings. \n\nExcluding concerts, the company’s domestic/overseas \n\nrevenue seems solid. GOT7’s new album, #Eyes On You, \n\nsold 310,000 copies, driving up the company’s album/digital \n\nsong sales by 10% y -o-y for 1Q18. Other revenue also \n\nincreased 38.2% y -o-y, backed by increased YouTube ad \n\nrevenue and TWICE’s J apanese fan club member ship fees. \n\nAlbum/digital song and digital contents sales, which are not \n\ngenerated from artist service, enjoy higher margin s than \n\nconcerts or commercial fees. As a result, J YP’s GPM \n\nimproved 7ppts y -o-y in 1Q18. Album/digital song sales and \n\nother revenue ha ve recorded the strongest growth among \n\nJ YP’s business divisions over the past three years, indicating \n\nthat structural growth is highly likely for the company’s \n\nGPM. \n\nWe expect J YP to post revenue of KRW32.4bn (+14% y -o-y) \n\nand OP of KRW8.5bn (+23% y -o-y) f or 2Q18, backed by the \n\nreflection of: i) domestic/overseas album/digital song sales of \n\nTWICE’s What Is Love (estimated at over 400,000 copies); \n\nand ii) world tour concert revenue (GOT7 and TWICE). With \n\nstock compensation costs retreating to c.KRW200m, SG&A \n\nexpenses should normalise in 2Q18.

Target price of KRW30,000 (2019F PE of 33x) \n\nWe initiate our coverage on J YP Entertainment with a BUY \n\nrating and TP of KRW30,000. We derived our TP by applying \n\nSM and YG’s 2013 -2015 average PE of 33x to 2019 F EPS of \n\nKRW916. During 2013 -2015, SM and YG showed sharp \n\noverseas revenue growth. We think the performance of \n\nJ YP’s artist portfolio will be fully reflected in 2019 earnings, \n\nincluding: i) overse as revenue from activities of TWICE and \n\nGOT7; ii) a new girl group to debut in 2H18; and iii) two \n\nidol groups to debut in China. \n\nJ YP is currently trading at a forward 12 -month PE of 28.6x \n\non similar levels with SM (29x) and YG (22.9x). A lthough the \n\ncompa ny may not look attractive from these numbers , we \n\nthink a premium valuation can be justified for J YP for the \n\nfollowing reasons. First of all, a total of four idol groups will \n\nmake their debut in Korea or C hina in 2018, compared with \n\nonly one team each for SM and YG. Depending on their \n\nperformance, earnings estimates are likely to be revised \n\nupwards. We have not reflected new idol group’s \n\nperformance aggressively in our 2018 and 2019 earnings \n\nestimates. J YP’s main artists, TWICE and GOT7, also show \n\nstronger growth potential than other companies’ artists, in \n\nview of their relatively later debut. The company also boasts \n\nhigher GPM and OPM than its peers. We estimate its EPS \n\ngrowth at 46% for 2019, much higher than SM’s 9% and \n\nYG’s 17%. \n\nT op 3 entertainment com panies’ 2019F EPS growth  T op 3 entertainment companies’ YTD stock performances

In 2001, the company was retitled as JYP Entertainment.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JYP_Entertainment#cite_note-7) In 1997, the company signed its first artist – [Pearl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_(singer) \"Pearl (singer)\").\n\nIn 1999, entertainment company [SidusHQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHQ_(company) \"IHQ (company)\") introduced the future members of boy band [G.o.d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.o.d \"G.o.d\") to Park, as their producer and mentor.

In particular, both Korea and Japan market recorded all-time high sales, driving the company’s overall growth.\n\nNext, we will provide details on revenue per segment and region.\n\n3Q album sales recorded high yoy growth of 27% as major artists released new albums. DAY6’s outstanding chart performance drove domestic streaming sales by 86% yoy.\n\nConcert revenue also increased significantly by 88% yoy. With a large increase in concerts, MD sales expanded 58% yoy, achieving record-high quarterly revenue. In addition, other management revenue such as advertisement, continued incremental growth with artist diversification and mass audience expansion.\n\nBy region, Korea and Japan revenue set new all-time high quarterly revenue and helped to lead overall company’s growth. Especially in Japan, quarterly MD revenue increased significantly, reaching a new high level.\n\nAs highlighted, we recorded the highest quarterly operating profit of 48 billion won. With significant growth of top line, profitability recovered back to previous level. Despite the rise in contents production costs and other expenses, GPM expanded up to 50% level with increase in revenue. Also, we achieved a high OPM level of nearly 30%.\n\nJYP360 recorded 3Q sales of 32 billion won and an operating profit of 3.4 billion won. In addition, profitability of JYP360 improved, and its OPM reached 11% this quarter.\n\nNext, we will provide a detailed breakdown of revenue.\n\nAlbum revenue was 55 billion won with 27% yoy growth from new album releases from Stray Kids, NMIXX, Tzuyu Solo, and DAY6.\n\nDomestic streaming revenue reached the highest quarterly level of 3 billion won. DAY6, as they entered into 10th year after the debut, achieved a new career-high, dominating the domestic charts with both new releases and catalogues.\n\nConcert revenue was 22 billion won from Stray Kids world tours and sizable Japan fan meetings, DAY6 and ITZY’s world tours.\n\nFrom the expansion of concerts, MD recorded an all-time high quarterly revenue of over 50 billion won with 58% yoy growth. Japan MD sales reached the highest level from TWICE stadium concerts and NiziU, NEXZ fan meetings. In addition, a reflection of SKZOO online MD sales from JYP360 further expanded the growth of the company's MD sales.\n\nWith artist diversification and mass audience expansion, appearances and advertisement revenue continued to record incremental growth.\n\nOthers segment decreased by 9 billion won yoy. The factors that resulted in the decrease were 1) the reclassification of JYP360 shipping revenue since 4Q of 2023, 2) a change in the revenue recognition method of JYP Publishing’s overseas sales, and 3) Japan fan club sales. JYP Publishing’s overseas revenue which was previously recognized in 1Q & 3Q, has been adjusted accordingly to accrual accounting principles and is now reflected proportionally per each quarter. In addition, revenue recognition of the Japan fan club, which was previously recognized as a lump-sum, has been changed to a period-based method.\n\nNext we’ll provide details of expenses.\n\nContent production cost and other expenses increased by 13 billion won and 2 billion won. Despite such increases, the company achieved a significant GPM of 49.2%.\n\nLabor cost within SG&A rose by 4 billion won yoy. Within labor cost, fixed cost increased by 2 billion won. Commission fee expanded by 5 billion won from a rise in JYP360 related fees, a variable cost, which increases as JYP360 revenue grows. However, even with the rise in SG&A, JYP Entertainment recorded a high OPM of 28.4%.\n\nNon operating expenses include loss in fair value assessment of 4by4, which was reduced by 0.7 billion from stock price decrease. Regarding corporate tax, 10 billion won was reflected.\n\nNext, we will present artists’ activity outlook and investment highlights.\n\nJYP Entertainment plans to continue sustainable growth by leveraging its accumulated management capabilities and experiences in a long-term perspective. Such growth will be achieved through the retention of existing artists and the expansion of new artist line-ups. We aim to reinforce our strengths and leadership position in the global music industry through overseas strategic partnerships. Further, we are planning additional near-term growth through artist diversification. Based on these growth drivers, JYP Entertainment is expecting meaningful top line growth in 2025.\n\nDAY6 has resumed their activities after completing army service. They are dominating the Korean streaming charts with both new releases and catalogs. While the group has entered into the 10th year of debut, they are still growing and solidifying their status as an iconic K-pop band.

The group is preparing for a variety of activities based on new strategies and contents in 2025.\n\nNMIXX successfully held their second fan concert in October and started to expand their overseas fan base by attending Billboard Latin Music Week, the largest event in the Latin music industry, as the first K-pop group.
